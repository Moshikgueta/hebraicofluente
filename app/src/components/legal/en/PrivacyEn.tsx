        <p>
          The legal bases are: the <strong>performance of the contract</strong> you made with us
          (art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) for everything about your access and progress; <strong>legal
          obligations</strong> for the tax data of the order and for the access log; our{' '}
          <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (art. 6(1)(f)) in keeping the service secure, protecting
          the course against copying and keeping backups; and your <strong>consent</strong> (art. 6(1)(a))
          where the table says so.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Backups.</strong> Once a day we make a copy of the database, stored privately at
          Cloudflare and, encrypted (unreadable without our password), also on Google Drive, to restore the
          service if something goes wrong. Each copy is deleted automatically after <strong>90 days</strong>.
          If you delete your account, your data leaves the system at once and leaves the backups when they
          expire; until then, backups are only used to restore the service, never for anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Recording your voice.</strong> In the lessons, in the reading texts and in the
          demonstration on the home page (even without an account) you can record yourself reading, to hear
          yourself. The browser asks for permission to use the microphone, and the recording stays on your
          device only: it disappears when you leave the page and is never sent to us or anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pronunciation check.</strong> If you use &ldquo;Speak and get feedback&rdquo;, in the
          lessons or in the demonstration on the home page, your speech is transcribed by your
          browser&apos;s speech recognition service - Google&apos;s, in Chrome and on Android, or
          Apple&apos;s, in Safari and on the iPhone - under the privacy rules of whoever made the browser.
          The course does not receive your audio: it receives only the transcribed text, compares it with
          the word on screen and does not keep it. If you prefer your voice not to leave your device, use
          only &ldquo;Record mine&rdquo;.

          <><strong>Resend</strong>: delivers our emails (password reset, purchase receipt, up to three reminders to start the course in the first days after buying, and notices about your account).

        ]} />
        <p>
          The company is in Brazil, and Paddle, Resend, Cloudflare, GitHub, Google and Meta are companies
          based in other countries, so part of the processing happens on servers outside the country where
          you live, including the United States. These transfers are necessary to perform the contract you
          made with us - they are what lets the site respond, the payment happen, the email arrive and
          support answer.

      <Artigo n={4} titulo="Cookies and measurement">
        <p>
          We use one <strong>session cookie</strong>, needed to keep you signed in. It is signed, short-lived
          and cannot be used to track your browsing elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your browser also keeps your progress locally, so the course works offline, and some of your
          preferences (such as the accessibility settings). That stays on your device only. We use no
          advertising cookies, no ad network and no third-party script to measure audience. The Paddle
          checkout, which only loads on the payment page, is Paddle&apos;s and follows Paddle&apos;s
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve the lessons, people signed in to the course also send, in batches, learning counts
          only: what type of exercise, from which lesson, whether the answer was right or wrong, and which
          step of which lesson was completed for the first time, with the time range it took (for example,
          &ldquo;between 2 and 4 minutes&rdquo;, counting only the time the page was visible and in use;
          never the exact time). The server adds these numbers up by day and does not keep name, email,
          account, IP address, time of day or what you typed. The totals are deleted after a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the free demo on the course page, the browser sends only the name of each step you reached,
          once per visit, so we know where people stop. On the first page you open, the browser notes where
          you came from, in a closed list of categories (such as &ldquo;search&rdquo;, &ldquo;email&rdquo;
          or &ldquo;ad&rdquo;) and, if the link has one, the campaign name; that note stays on your device
          for 30 days, without a cookie, and reaches the server only as a daily total and, if you buy, on
          the order, so we know which channels bring students. The server keeps no name, email, account, IP
          address, time of day or exact site you came from for any of these counts. The totals are deleted
          after a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the demo you can ask for the second letter by email. If you do not tick the box
          for the next letters, the address you type is used only to send that email and is not kept or
          added to any list. So as not to send twice on the same day, the server keeps for up to 48 hours a
          code calculated from the address, which cannot be turned back into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The interest list.</strong> If you tick the box for the next letters at the end of the
          demo, or ask to be told when a course opens, we keep your email, what you asked for, the category
          you came from and the dates of sign-up. The legal basis is your consent. Your sign-up only counts
          after you confirm it through the link in the first email; without confirmation nothing else is
          sent and the address is deleted in 7 days. Every email on the list carries a link to leave, which
          works without signing in; when you leave, your email is deleted from the list and we send nothing
          more.

          What deletion removes: email, name, password, progress and access to the course. What it does not
          remove, because the law does not allow it: the record of your purchases, which stays without your
          name and without your email, because keeping sales records is an obligation of the seller. What
          remains is the amount, date and status of the payment, and it does not point to you. For the same
          reason the <strong>access logs</strong> from the last six months stay until they reach the period
          the law sets, and are then deleted.
